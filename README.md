# Bonken score form

A webpage to fill out and calculate your scores during a game of
Bonken.

## Compile

To compile, install TypeScript and compile `bonken-score.ts` to
javascript. I use `ES6` as the output target.

## Run

To run in a browser, just load `bonken-score.html` into your page. You
don't need a server, you can just open it with e.g.
`file:///.../bonken-score.html`.
